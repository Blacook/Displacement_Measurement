# Displacement_Measurement

This Web App is to measure the displacement of AMR on transformation and rotation.

=== How to use ===

1. Put the ruler on the tire and mark the marker on the floor when you create POI.

2. Move AMR to the POI with the marker and put the ruler on the same tire.

3. Take a picture of the object which is the standard of length and make sure that the camera is horizontal to the floor.
   I recommend taking a picture at 77.5 cm of height from the floor.

5. Upload the image.

6. Click both ends of the object on the image to calibrate the length.

7. Click three points in order of the vertex of the marker and each point on the two edge lines interposing the vertex.

8. Click three points in order of the vertex of the ruler and each point on the two edge lines interposing the vertex.
